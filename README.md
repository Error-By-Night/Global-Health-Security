# Global Health Security | Info 201 Final Project
## Why are you interested in this field/domain?
We are interested in the domain of global health security because as we are currently experiencing a pandemic, it is important for countries to be more readily prepared for other infectious disease outbreaks in the future. When the pandemic first started, Covid-19 had a large impact on the world both socially and economically. Many people in the workforce lost their jobs, borders closed, businesses closed, and much more. Here, we would like to visualize and identify countries with low security indexes to inform ourselves and eventually develop ways to help improve their benchmarks.

## What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share  **at least 3**)?
[GHS Index](https://www.ghsindex.org/), is a project driven by the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, and Economist Impact. Through different visualizations, users can find the overall GHS index score of up to 195 countries along with their *rank, overall change, region, population, and income.* From the homepage, users can also select a specific index category including *prevent, detect, respond, health, norms, risk* and search for any country as well.

[World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/data), is an agency under the United Nations concerning international public health. Here, users can find data on many different topics including Covid-19, immunizations, mortality rates, and more in many different visual formats. Users can also narrow their search down by different regions, age, and many other ways.

[Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/), is a nonprofit organization  created to help communities protect themselves from epidemics and pandemics. From their website, you can find many different projects relating to global health and other related topics including vaccination rates, bioeconomy, and more.

## What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share **at least 3**)?
- What region has the most countries with the lowest index scores?
- In which category from the 6 in the GHS did countries score the worse/best in?
- What was the average index score in each income level? 

## Global Health Security Data
### GHS Index - 2019 to Present
The [Global Health Security Index](https://www.ghsindex.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021_GHSindexFullReport_Final.pdf) (GHS) is an organization responsible for creating all of the index scores for each country. Research is conducted through the Economist Impact where several qualitative assessments are made through publicly available information about each country and through existing quantitative datasets using a multidimensional analytical framework. There are 390 observations and x features in the dataset. Using this dataset, all three questions can be answered.

### Country ranking and score based on the Global Health Survey index - 2020
Provided by Plos One, this [dataset](https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Country_ranking_and_score_based_on_the_Global_Health_Survey_index_/13062161/1) is created by several researchers from different universities, designed to help countries see how prepared they would be for another pandemic based on different scores from 0 to 100. The ranking for each feature is also given for each country. There are 35 observations and 8 features in this dataset. Only questions 1 and 2 can be answered using this dataset.  

#### COVID-19 Pandemic and Global Health Security Index - 2020
Using the GHS Index and other sources from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at JHU, this [dataset](https://knoema.com/ychqncc/the-global-health-security-ghs-index) from Knoema allows you to visualize the data given by the GHS index into many different graphs. There are 194 observations (countries) and 7 features (indicators), allowing you to precisely select specific countries that you would like to gain more information on.
